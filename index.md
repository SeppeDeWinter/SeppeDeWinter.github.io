# Seppe De Winter

I am a PhD student at KU Leuven university. I study regulatory genomics using large scale omics data, machine learning methods and a variety of model systems (ranging from chicken 🐣 to organoids 🧫).

Research software: [pycistarget](https://github.com/aertslab/pycistarget), [pycisTopic](https://github.com/aertslab/pycisTopic), [SCENIC+](https://github.com/aertslab/scenicplus)
